Fixed last step of undo zoom sometimes going "nowhere".
"SWS/AdamWathan: Fade in/out/crossfade selected area of selected items" now fades in/out to edit cursor if the edit cursor is inside the item and there is no time selection touching the item. It also "crops" the fade in/out to the time selection of a selected item if the selection is completely contained within the item.
"SWS/AdamWathan: Record Conditional (normal record mode unless time sel exists, then autopunch)" now doesn't change modes if the current mode is "Auto Punch Selected Items".
Added "SWS/AdamWathan: Record (automatically group simultaneously recorded items)" which will automatically group simultaneously recorded items if you are toggling in and out of record during playback. Also added the "conditional" version of the same thing for anyone using the conditional action in place of the native action.

!v1.8.2 #5 (October 22, 2010)
There's a few new zoom tool features!  http://www.standingwaterstudios.com/shup/zoomTool4.gif|Here's a demo|.
To access the new features, use the SWS Zoom preferences dialog.  You can find it in the Extensions menu.
The available options are:
+Zoom with middle mouse button
<i>Use the middle mouse button to drag-zoom.  Note this overrides Reaper's middle mouse button behavior, e.g. scrub.</i>
+No-drag click zooms to item under cursor
<i>Clicking without dragging in zoom mode on an item zooms to that item</i>
+No-drag click to undo zoom
<i>Clicking goes to the previous zoom level/position.  If you have item zoom mode on (above option), then undo zoom works when you're clicking on empty space.</i>
+Unzoom mode when dragging up (Windows only)
<i>When in zoom mode, drag the box in the up direction to get a little representation of the current view, and the box around it will be the "new view".  Try it!</i>

I consider this an interim release, the above options will be added to and refined soon.
Also fixed zoom bugs when the master track is visible in the TCP.

+Added action SWS/AdamWathan: Record (conditional, normal record mode unless time sel exists, then autopunch)
+Updated AdamWathan Fill Gaps function, now gives option to automatically add markers marking potential artifacts after filling gaps

!v1.8.0 #1 (September 20, 2010)
<b>REQUIRES REAPER v3.66 - These are the released changes from Beta #6! - Mostly S&M updates:</b>

Added new dockable view "S&M Live Configs" and 8 actions "Apply live config n (MIDI CC only)" where n is [1,8].
This is for live performance: optimize CPU/RAM use, get rid of the 16 MIDI channel limit, etc.
Typical workflow example: route your armed input track to the tracks you have configured in the "Live Configs" view.  Then, while playing, you send CC messages (previoulsy learnt) to automatically switch between those tracks/configurations you have defined: mute all tracks except the active one, mute all receives from the input track except for the active one, load track templates, load FX Chains and/or run custom actions when activating/deactivating a config.
These actions belong to a new section "S&M Extension". See details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=63775|here|.  Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/LiveConfig.gif|here|.
Added action "SWS/S&M: Open Live Configs window..." (in the main section)

Build lane actions updated:
+Now, the lanes order always match the recording order and work with all media types (including MIDI in-project ones).
+Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/buildlanes.gif|here|.
+Limitation: for the moment, "building lanes" on *imploded* isn't supported, details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=577538&postcount=68|here|.
+Added action "SWS/S&M: Takes - Activate lane under mouse cursor"

S&M FX Chain view improvments:
+Paste of FX Chains in now possible (only FX Chain replacement was possible until now)
+External drag-drop of FX Chains (e.g. drag from an external explorer, drop into the view)
+Internal drag-drop of FX Chains (drag from the view, drop in a track) - Windows OS only
+Added actions:
SWS/S&M: Paste FX chain to selected items
SWS/S&M: Paste FX chain to selected items, all takes
SWS/S&M: Paste FX chain to selected tracks
+Renamed actions, added "(replace)" to make things clear:
SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) FX chain to selected items
SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) FX chain to selected items, all takes
SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) FX chain to selected tracks
+Added popup items "Add slot", "Insert slot" and "Delete slots"
+Text filter added, demo http://stash.reaper.fm/6083/FXChainFiltering.gif|here|
+Simplified display in the "Path" column (when using REAPER's FX Chains default path)
+Added a column "Description", double-click to enter some text. Note: it's volountary not used when filtering.
+Safer cut/copy/paste actions

Added new dockable view "S&M Notes/help" for item notes, track notes and, on Win, custom/online action help:
+Online help (link to the http://www.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Action_List_Reference|Action List Reference|): click on the action name.
+When enabled, the lock button just allows key stroke to pass through the main window.
+S&M Notes/help & S&M Find demo: http://reaper.mj-s.com/notes_and_find.gif|here|.
+Added related actions:
SWS/S&M: Open Notes/help window...
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to action help - Windows OS only
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to item notes
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to track notes
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to project notes (disable auto updates)  (<i>Note this is *not* REAPER's project notes.</i>)
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Set action help file...
<i>This action sets the filename where your custom notes about actions will be saved (so that you can have different ones, e.g. multi-language). By default this file is set for you, it's S&M_Action_help_en.ini (in REAPER's default resource directory, with other ini files). It's where *action* notes are saved, other notes (item, track and project) are saved in RPP files.</i>
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Toggle lock

Added new dockable view "S&M Find" (bound to Ctrl-F) with find all, previous & next buttons.
Simple: when something matches, it's selected.
The available search scopes are: item names, item names (all takes), media filenames, media filenames (all takes), item notes, track notes, track names (in case you're drunk) and marker/region names.

Track folders actions:
+SWS/S&M: Save selected tracks folder states
+SWS/S&M: Restore selected tracks folder states
+SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to on
+SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to off <i>note: the 2 previous ones are different from native action "Cycle track folder state"</i>
+SWS/S&M: Save selected tracks folder compact states
+SWS/S&M: Restore selected tracks folder compact states

+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all receive volume envelopes for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all receive pan envelopes for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all receive mute envelopes for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all plugin envelopes for selected tracks
+Remarks:
These actions only apply for ACTIVE envelopes (i.e. these actions don't create envelopes)
Send envelopes are not (yet) managed, use receive envelopes instead
As these toggle actions act on several tracks, the reported toggle state is a "best effort" one

Action List Reference summaries auto generation (Wiki copy/pastable) - Windows OS only
+See details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=61929|here|. ALR: http://www.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Action_List_Reference|here|.
+SWS/S&M: Save ALR Wiki summary (w/o extensions)
+SWS/S&M: Save ALR Wiki summary (SWS/Xenakios/S&M extensions only)

+SWS/S&M: Delete active take and source file in selected items (no undo) (<i>On Win, source files are moved to the recycle bin.</i>)
+Preview selected media item at track fader volume (toggle)

Misc updates:
+Better management of the "S&M" ini file: it's now located in REAPER's default resource path (i.e. with other ini files) rather than "<REAPER_install_dir>/Plugins/"
+Slight action renaming (mispelling, better display order)
+Auto-icon from betas is turned off due to too many issues.
+Fixed action "Randomize item positions"

!v1.7.3 #4 (August 29, 2010)

<b>Requires REAPER v3.651!</b>

S&M updates:
+Added actions:
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Hide all CC lanes
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Create CC lane
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Save displayed CC lanes, slot <i>n</i> (n: 1..4)
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Set displayed CC lanes, slot <i>n</i> (n: 1..4)
Note: those actions apply to the active MIDI Editor but only belong to the main section of the action list, for the moment. Displayed CC lanes are saved in the S&M.ini file.
- SWS/S&M: Cycle focused window (Windows OS only)
This actions need to be bind with a special modifier in order to pass-thru the main window (example: Ctrl Shift a).
Also, few windows eat keystrokes, it will not work for them (e.g. action list which text filter is focused by default).
- SWS/S&M: Let REAPER breathe
This action only makes sense for corner cases macros (see MIDI Editor example http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=60657|here|)
+Fixes:
- issue 140, part of issue 161
- FX Chain view: fixed "Clear slot" actions

!v1.7.2 #10 (June 14, 2010)
S&M updates:
+All S&M toggle actions now report their toggle states to toolbar buttons and menus
Notes: with a mix of different toggle states (e.g. toggle something for several tracks), the state will be a "best effort" one. Also, native "limitation": button states aren't always refreshed (contray to their tooltips..)
+Updated following actions so that floating FX are hidden when the main window gets the focus
SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX for selected tracks (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX for selected tracks (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX (& main window on cycle)
+Added actions: alternative to native actions, they split -only- and all selected items, see details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=51547|here| :
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at play cursor
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit cursor (no change selection)
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection (select left)
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection (select right)
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit or play cursor
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit or play cursor (ignoring grouping)
SWS/gofer: Split selected items at mouse cursor (obey snapping)
Note: this one is from gofer (REAPER forum member), it was just traduced from Python. Usefull with an armed toolbar button.
+Fixes:
All cycle FX focus/float-only actions (corner case issues with the master track)
Some float, unfloat FX actions with multiple track selection

!v1.7.2 #9 (June 6, 2010)

SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX for selected tracks (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX (& main window on cycle)
Reminder: for "alt-tabish" switch between FX, these actions need to be bind with special modifiers in order to pass-thru the main window (example: focus next/previous = Ctrl Shift a/b)
SWS/S&M: Split items at time selection (if exists), else at cursor (MIDI) or at prior zero crossing (audio)
+Action list clean-up (wording updates as proposed in issue 119)

+FX chain view enhancement (customizable double-click behavior)
+Better behavior for cycle FX window actions.
+When a mutli selection occurs, now the following actions will cycle between FXs *and* tracks:
- SWS/S&M: Float previous FX (and close others) for selected track(s)
- SWS/S&M: Float next FX (and close others) for selected track(s)
- SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX window for selected track(s)
