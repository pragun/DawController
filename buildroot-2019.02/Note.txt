The SDCard.img here works great, and even better with the following changes

A. SSHD
DropBear will create new ssh host keys everytime it boots up. The fix is to 
0. Set root password
1. Mount / as rw
2. Remove the symlinked /etc/dropbear
3. Create a normal folder /etc/dropbear
4. ssh into localhost, thereby forcing dropbear to create new keys
4(alt). Use dropbearkey to create a host key
5. Enjoy


B. Inittab
1. Add this to inittab 
tty1::respawn::/bin/sh -c "cd /root/dawcontroller; /usr/bin/python dawcontroller.py"
2. Move all the sysvinit stuff after dawcontroller

C. To take out about one second of bootup time
1. Remove console on ttyAMA0 from cmdline.txt
2. To do this remount / as rw
3. mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 as /mnt/boot (might have to make that path)
4. nano cmdline.txt, and remove the two console parameters
